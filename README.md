LORE (Some of it): Everyone lived happy on earth, and the angels were protecting earth at all costs, but Heaven was COLD, so let's call them, Demons from the underworld told them that the angels could stay and basically chill out there. SO the angels agreed, but since they weren't able to protect humans, everything gone wrong, there were WARS, and other stuff going on that the earth population started to decrease, humans HAD to make machines to stop all of this, and when the angels saw what was happening, they stopped protecting the earth COMPLETLY, and half of the population was turned to "Sinners" or "Believers", it got even worse when the machines went out of control, and a zombie plauge started, now it was the war between, Machines, Sinners, Believers, Humans, and Zombies. The Humans managed to contain at least something, and were trapping all of them in different high security basements, sewers, and even in catacombs, and that's where we come in. We play as a Machine called Mark - 404, that have escaped an underground basement, and our goal, is to kill everything and everyone, the first location is the Doomed City, where we start of in the 2 towers, realising everyone from it, and that's when we see the biggest machine every made: Brut. A machine that got out of control also, and is killing everything, so since our goal is to kill everything, we make it to the city, go insade of the BRUT, destroy him, and continue our journey, to destroy everything powerfull first, so then it will be easier to destroy everything small.
That is pretty much it for the LORE we have so far.
